# Roastulator üéØ

## Basic Details
### Team Name: LFX

### Team Members
- Team Lead: Nihal K - Farook College(Autonomous), Kozhikode

### Project Description
The Roastulator is a web-based calculator with a sharp-tongued personality. It evaluates user-input math expressions and, instead of just giving the answer, it delivers a witty, context-aware roast generated by an AI. The simpler the math, the harsher the roast.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In today's world, calculators are too supportive. They give you answers without judgment, fostering a dangerously positive and stress-free environment for basic arithmetic. This coddling is creating a generation that lacks the emotional resilience that can only be forged by being mocked for using a calculator for 2+2.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We've engineered the perfect solution: the Roastulator. It's a calculator that doesn't just do your math; it questions your life choices while doing it. By integrating the Gemini API, we've given our calculator a variety of fun, roasting personas, ensuring every calculation comes with a side of hilarious humiliation.
